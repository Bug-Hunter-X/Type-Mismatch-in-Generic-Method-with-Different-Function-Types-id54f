This code demonstrates a common Scala error related to type inference and generic methods.  The `myMethod` function in `MyClass` accepts a function `f: T => String`. When `MyClass` is instantiated with an `Int`, applying the toString method works, but with a `String`, applying the `length` method results in a compilation error because `length` returns an `Int`, not a `String` as expected by `myMethod`.
